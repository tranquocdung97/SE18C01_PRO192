/*
Task
Write a program that accepts the radius r of a circle from the user then displays the circumference of that circle knowing that Ï€ = 3.14:

Circumference = {P}
Where {P} is the circumference of a circle with radius r.

For example, if you input the following value:

7.5
the code will produce the following result:
Circumference = 47.1
