/*
Task
Write a program to declare 2 integer variables a and b, assign value 6 to a and 2 to b and display the following expressions on the screen:

a + b = {P1}
a - b = {P2}
a * b = {P3}
a / b = {P4}
where:

{P1} is the sum of a and b.

{P2} is the difference between a and b.

{P3} is the product of a and b.

{P4} is the quotient of a and b.
