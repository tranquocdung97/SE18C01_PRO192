/**
Task
Write a program to calculate the sum of 313 and 122.

Theory
In addition to using System.out.println() statement to print information of characters on the screen, you can use this statement to print the sum, difference, product or quotient. See the example below:

public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
       System.out.println(8 + 4);
       System.out.println(8 - 4);
       System.out.println(8 * 4);
       System.out.println(8 / 4);
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

12
4
32
2
Now you can write a simple Java program to calculate the sum, difference, product or quotient.

An example that calculates the product of 17 and 18:

public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
       System.out.println(17 * 18);
   }
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

306
Now you can return to the Task and solve it or refer to the instruction below.

Instruction
Code sample:

public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
       System.out.println(313 + 122);
   }
}
 */
public class Exc4 {
       public static void main(String[] args) 
   {
       System.out.println(313 + 122);
   }
}
