Task
Fill in the blank (...) to complete to the program that displays the following line on the screen:

Hello, World!
Theory
In Java, to print a line of text on the screen, we use System.out.println() stetament. For example, to display the text "Hello Java" on the screen, do the following:

public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		System.out.println("Hello Java");
	}
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

Hello Java
There are some statements in the code that you are not familiar with such as public class HelloWorld or public static void main(String[]args) but you do not have to pay attention to them in this lesson. You can assume that they are the required parts of a Java program.

Now you can write a program to display your name on the screen. For example, if your name is Nguyen Van Nam, the program that displays your name is as below:

public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		System.out.println("Nguyen Van Nam");
	}
}
In a Java program, System.out.println() is used to print values on the screen.

Now you can return to the Task and solve it or refer to the instruction below.

Instruction
To solve the task, you just need to replace ... with System.out.println("Hello, World!");

Code sample:

public class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		System.out.println("Hello, World!");
	}
}
